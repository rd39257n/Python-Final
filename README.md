# California Housing Price Prediction - Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the course, which focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning applied to the California Housing dataset.

## Files Included

* `Code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code for EDA, preprocessing, and machine learning models.
* `housing.csv`: Dataset used (based on the 1990 California Census).
* `Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning on California Housing Dataset.docx`: Final report in Word format.
* `Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning on California Housing Dataset.pdf`: Final report in PDF format.
* `Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning on California Housing Prices.pptx`: Presentation slide deck.
* `video.mp4`: Recorded video presentation demonstrating project findings.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the California Housing dataset to:

* Perform detailed EDA with visualizations (heatmaps, histograms, scatter plots).
* Apply regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
* Classify house value categories using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.

## Dataset

* Source: [Kaggle - California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
* Features include geographic, demographic, and economic variables.

## Technologies Used
